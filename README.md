Software Engineering Boot Camp - Task 14

Compulsory Task 1
Follow these steps:
● Create a program called “task1.py”.
● This program needs to display the timetables for any number.
● For example, say the user enters 6 the program must print:
The 6 times table is:
6 x 1 = 6
6 x 2 = 12
…
6 x 12 = 72
● Compile, save and run your file.

Compulsory Task 2
Follow these steps:
A simple rule to determine whether a year is a leap year is to test whether it is a multiple of 4.
● Create a program called “task2.py”.
● Write a program to input a year and a number of years.

1996 is a leap year
1997 isn’t a leap year
1998 isn’t a leap year
1999 isn’t a leap year
2000 is a leap year
2001 isn’t a leap year
● Compile, save and run your file.
